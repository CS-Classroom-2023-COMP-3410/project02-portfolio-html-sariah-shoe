        <p>Hello! My name is Sariah Shoemaker. I am a Computer Science student at the University of Denver. In my free time I love to write. When I'm not writing, I'm usually thinking about my stories. I created this website for a Computer Science assignment and I figured, why not show off my creative side too?</p>
