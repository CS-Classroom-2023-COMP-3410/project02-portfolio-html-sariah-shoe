                    <h2>Creative Works I Enjoy</h2>
                    <!-- I included more than just traditional novels because I love stories of all kinds -->
                    <dir>
                        <li><b>Hellblazer</b>
                            <div>Hellblazer is a horror comic book series starring John Constantine.
                                <br>John Constantine is one of my favorite characters. 
                                <br>He is a flawed character with great humor as he faces unspeakable horrors.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sherlock Holmes</b>
                            <div>I enjoy Sherlock Holmes adaptations but I find his original written version especially fascinating.
                                <br>I like the language used in older writing and the 'unfiltered' version of Holmes.
                                <br>Holmes solves crimes while on cocaine and often doesn't tell his partner anything until the story is over.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>My Adventures With Superman</b>
                            <div>Superman is another character I enjoy. I like the contrast between sweet Clark Kent and the unstoppable Man of Steel.
                                <br>My Adventures With Superman captures his character very well and provides fun spin-offs of characters around him.
                                <br>It both respects the comics and comes up with something new. That's a hard balance to strike.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Detroit Become Human</b>
                            <div>This is a game I recently finished playing through. It is a story-based game about androids in Detroit.
                                <br>The game doesn't pull any punches. Terrible things happen to your characters, and I like that.
                                <br>It makes me invested in the game and truly gives me the feeling that my choices matter.
                                <br>It also leaves you with a lot to think about. What makes someone human?
