I made this website using mostly ChatGPT. I have created basic websites before but I haven't done it with AI before. AI definetly sped up the process but I had to watch it carefully. Despite having directions to not use CSS, ChatGPT would generate a few iterations of the page with CSS before going to straight HTML. I spent the most time on the home page. Once I decided how I wanted that styled, I copied the styling for my other pages.

I had some trouble with the paths for my images. I put an unneeded slash at the start and I forgot to go back a directory for the projects page.
